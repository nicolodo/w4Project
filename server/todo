make a supa db and make it have a few columns of interest

make an .env file to put the link to the db
so that it's hidden from threat actors

and style the client page so it looks good on mobile

make the client and server.js code.
for the client page make a form with those things 
to fill in

 -- can use postman to make post requests to the server.js
 -- if the client is not setup yet.
deploy the server and client code onto render.com
so its hosted there
